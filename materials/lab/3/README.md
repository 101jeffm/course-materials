# Lab 3 - PART 2 
Due Feb 25th at 11:59PM

Lab3Dir : ~workspace/course_materials/materials/lab/3

Within {Lab3Dir}/shodan/shodan there are three files.

Two access different [Shodan API methods](https://developer.shodan.io/api)
 - host.go →Host/Search
 - api.go → APIInfo

The third file `shodan.go` contains a helper function to create a new client (with the API you provide on the command line; see README's for more details on usage)

## Part 1(12 points)

### Option 1: 
Create another method file (like host.go/api.go) to access another method.
### Option 2: 
Extend host.go to build up more complex queries
### Option 3: 
Create a helper file to pull currently available facets and filters

### Required:
Update the README in the shodan/shodan directory to discuss which option you selected and what files you created/modified.

## Part 2 (8 points)
Extend {Lab3Dir}/shodan/main/main.go to use your new functionality

### Required

 Update the README in the shodan/main directory to discuss HOW to use your program (provide example command-line usages)
